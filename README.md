## Project Description

**1. Who is it for?**

SketchConnect is designed for groups of four friends or family members, or really, anyone who enjoys doodling.

**2. What will it do?**

Players will sequentially draw in their assigned sections of a 2x2 grid, with only the slight glimpse of the bordering segments' drawings visible. Once everyone has finished, the four sections merge, revealing the collective masterpiece!

**3. What type of data will it store?**

Each SketchConnect session will be stored as a distinct record in our database. A single session (or game) will house up to the information of four logged-in users, their respective drawings, and the final combined artwork.

**4. What will users be able to do with this data?**

The unique session IDs will be utilized to generate invite links for users to join a SketchConnect game. Upon the creation of the final combined artwork, users can laugh at and share their final drawing.

**5. What is some additional functionality you can add or remove based on time constraints?**

We have numerous ideas for enhancing the game experience, such as:
- Additional customization features for the drawing experience (e.g., brush colors, brush thickness, clear drawing, etc.)
- A timer to indicate the remaining drawing time for each player
- Options for public or private game rooms
- In-game group chats for player communication
- Additional game modes (e.g., 3x3 grid, collaborative drawing modes, etc.)
